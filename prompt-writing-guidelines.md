## Basic Structure

The fundamental structure of a perfect prompt:

```
Create an ad image for [Product Name] that:
1. Uses [Reference Image] as inspiration
2. Features [Product Details]
3. Maintains [Style/Aesthetic]
4. Includes [Brand Elements]
```

## Visual References

Reference images are the foundation of successful ad generation. They provide concrete visual guidance that text alone cannot convey.

### Types of Reference Images to Include:
- **Layout References:** Show desired composition, spacing, and overall arrangement
- **Style References:** Demonstrate visual aesthetic, lighting, and mood
- **Product References:** Clear shots of your product from multiple angles
- **Brand References:** Examples of brand elements and typography

### Reference Image Handling:
- Upload a reference layout image (the ad you want to emulate)
- Upload your actual product photo separately
- The AI model automatically understands what you want to swap in or emphasize
- Upload screenshots of your website, logos, past ads for brand continuity

### Best Practices:
- Use high-quality, clear images without text overlays
- Provide multiple references for complex requests
- Label references clearly (e.g., "Use Image 1 for layout, Image 2 for lighting")
- Include both aspirational references and practical examples

### Example Prompt Structure with References:
```
Reference Image Instructions:
1. Layout: Follow the composition of Reference 1, maintaining the rule of thirds
2. Lighting: Match the soft, diffused lighting seen in Reference 2
3. Style: Adapt the minimal, clean aesthetic from Reference 3
4. Product: Replace the example product with our product, maintaining similar scale and positioning
```

### Real-World Example with References:
```
Reference Images:
1. Use Image 1 (high-end fashion magazine spread) for overall composition and lighting
2. Use Image 2 (our product photo) for accurate bottle details and branding
3. Use Image 3 (brand website screenshot) for typography and color scheme

Prompt:
"Create a luxury perfume ad that:
- Follows the composition of Image 1, with the bottle positioned at the rule of thirds intersection
- Maintains the soft, diffused lighting from Image 1, creating subtle shadows
- Uses our product photo (Image 2) as the main subject, ensuring the gold cap catches the light
- Incorporates our brand typography and color scheme from Image 3
- Adds a subtle gradient background in our brand colors
- Includes our logo in the bottom right corner at 10% of frame width"
```

## Style Direction

Style direction encompasses the visual language of your ad.

### Key Style Elements to Specify:

#### Lighting:
- Direction (overhead, side, front)
- Quality (soft, harsh, diffused)
- Temperature (warm, cool, neutral)
- Shadows (soft, sharp, none)

#### Atmosphere:
- Mood (energetic, calm, luxurious)
- Time of day (morning, evening)
- Season (summer freshness, winter cozy)
- Setting (studio, outdoor, lifestyle)

### Example Style Specification:
```
Style Specifications:
1. Lighting: [Type] lighting from [Direction] with [Quality] shadows
2. Color Palette: [Primary], [Secondary], [Accent] colors
3. Mood: [Atmosphere] feeling with [Style] aesthetic
4. Environment: [Setting] with [Details] and [Props]
5. Post-Processing: [Effects] and [Adjustments]
```

### Real-World Style Example:
```
Style Direction:
"Create a modern tech ad with:
- High-key lighting from above and slightly behind the product
- Cool, blue-tinted lighting to emphasize the product's sleek design
- Minimalist composition with the product centered
- Dark, gradient background (from #1a1a1a to #2a2a2a)
- Subtle lens flare effect to highlight the product's premium feel
- Clean, sans-serif typography in white
- Ample negative space to create a sense of luxury and sophistication"
```

## Product Placement

### Essential Product Details to Specify:

1. **Position:**
   - Exact placement in frame
   - Example: "Center-right, occupying 40% of frame height"

2. **Angle:**
   - Viewing perspective
   - Example: "45-degree angle showing front and side, tilted slightly upward"

3. **Focus:**
   - Key features to highlight
   - Example: "Ensure logo is clearly visible, highlight metallic finish"

4. **Context:**
   - Environmental interaction
   - Example: "Product casting natural shadow on marble surface"

### Advanced Placement Techniques:
- Use the rule of thirds for dynamic compositions
- Create depth with foreground/background elements
- Utilize leading lines to draw attention
- Balance negative space for visual impact

### Product Placement Template:
```
Product Placement Details:
1. Position: [Location in frame] at [Scale]% of frame
2. Angle: [Viewing angle] with [Rotation] degrees
3. Focus Areas: Highlight [Feature 1], [Feature 2]
4. Environment: [Surface type] with [Props/Context]
5. Lighting Focus: [Key light] highlighting [Specific area]
```

### Real-World Product Placement Example:
```
Product Placement:
"Position the watch in the frame as follows:
- Place the watch at a 45-degree angle, showing both the face and band
- Position it at the rule of thirds intersection (bottom right)
- Ensure the watch face occupies 30% of the frame height
- Highlight the metallic finish with directional lighting
- Include a subtle reflection on a polished surface
- Add a shallow depth of field to make the watch pop
- Ensure the brand logo on the face is clearly visible
- Include a small portion of the band to show the premium leather texture"
```

```

## Advanced Tips

### Iterative Approach:

#### Step 1: Foundation
- Basic composition and layout
- Product placement and scale
- Overall framing and perspective
- Initial lighting setup

#### Step 2: Enhancement
- Refine lighting and shadows
- Add atmospheric elements
- Adjust color grading
- Enhance product details

#### Step 3: Polish
- Add brand elements
- Fine-tune text placement
- Adjust final composition
- Add finishing touches

### Example Iteration Process:
```
Initial Prompt:
"Create an ad for our new perfume bottle"

After Step 1:
"Create a centered composition featuring our new perfume bottle at 45-degree angle, occupying 60% of frame height"

After Step 2:
"Create a centered composition featuring our new perfume bottle at 45-degree angle, occupying 60% of frame height. Use soft, diffused lighting from above with subtle rim lighting. Add a marble surface with a slight reflection."

Final Prompt:
"Create a centered composition featuring our new perfume bottle at 45-degree angle, occupying 60% of frame height. Use soft, diffused lighting from above with subtle rim lighting. Add a marble surface with a slight reflection. Place the brand logo in the top right corner at 10% of frame width. Add 'Elegance Redefined' in Helvetica Light at the bottom, centered."
