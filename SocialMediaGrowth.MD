**Post Template:**
_(Soft human launch style — like you did with ZappyToon)_

Example Reddit post:
> "Hey everyone!  
> I recently built AdMuseAI — a simple tool that helps small brands create high-quality ads just by uploading a product photo.  
>  
> I made it because my friends were launching their own car perfume product with zero budget and needed better ads fast.  
>  
> It’s free for a short while — would love your honest feedback if you want to try it! Link in the comments :)"

**Important:** Always put the **link in the first comment**, not in the post body.

# 🚀 Bonus: 3 Key Tips To Grow Faster
1. **Create 2-3 short videos every day** (even low effort ones). Volume > perfection.
2. **Ask users for feedback inside the tool** ("Was this ad helpful? Rate it!").
3. **Offer small incentives** for sharing ("Share your ad made with AdMuseAI and tag us — we'll reshare!").

# ⚡ Closing Note
You are in an amazing spot — you already have the early users (25+ ads created!).
